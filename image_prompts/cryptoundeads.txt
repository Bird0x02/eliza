A retro, 8-bit pixel art portrait of a stylized character with a bold red mohawk. The characterâ€™s face is mostly bright yellow, accented with a few teal and navy-blue pixels that give it a rugged, punk-inspired look. They wear large, rectangular black sunglasses that obscure the eyes, with a thin gray headband just above. A small cigarette is held in their mouth, producing a subtle wisp of smoke. Their neck or lower face area is dark navy blue, creating contrast with the yellow skin. The background is a muted, earthy brown to emphasize the vibrant colors of the mohawk and face. The overall style should evoke the feeling of classic pixel-based arcade graphics with chunky, blocky pixels, perfect for a collectible NFT aesthetic.
